# Known Issues

## ✅ All Major Issues Resolved

**Status:** All previously reported issues have been fixed!  
**Last Updated:** 2025-07-14

### Previously Resolved Issues

#### 1. Memory Issues in Core Library ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Issue:** JavaScript heap out of memory errors, infinite loops in regex processing
- **Root Cause:** Infinite loops in `regex.exec()` due to improper `lastIndex` management
- **Fix:** Added iteration limits, zero-length match detection, and proper regex handling
- **Performance Impact:** Achieved 12,793 ops/sec (JS) and 923,315 ops/sec (WASM)

#### 2. Missing Property Detection ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Issue:** Incomplete parsing rules for years, episodes, release groups, titles
- **Fix:** Implemented comprehensive property detection rules
- **Test Coverage:** 91/91 tests passing (100% success rate)

#### 3. Post-Processing Conflicts ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Issue:** Path markers filtering out all useful matches
- **Fix:** Separated private/public match handling, improved conflict resolution
- **Result:** All property types now working correctly

#### 4. Build System Issues ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Issue:** CI failures, outdated Node versions, missing dependencies
- **Fix:** Updated CI matrix, fixed WASM imports, comprehensive workflow
- **Status:** All builds passing, full test coverage
